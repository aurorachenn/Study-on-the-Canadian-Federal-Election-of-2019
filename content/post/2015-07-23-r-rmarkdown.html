<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Can we forecast Federal Election’s outcome, people’s favorite Party using voters personal information as variable? It seems no one has a definite answer on whether the election result is predictable, but it was stated by many scientists that there are correlations between voters’ factors and the candidate that he/she votes for. This is a very interesting and widely researched domain.</p>
<p>The dataset has gather the attitudes and options of Canadian during and after the federal election in 2019. Various variables have been collected by individuals such as age, education, citizenship, living place, and political interests. We noticed that most (nearly all) of the variables are categorical other than numerical value. Therefore, the study we carried out will focus on how Canadian political stands are explained by these categorical personal information. For the sake of simplicity we concentrate our analysis on the Party people will vote as first choice, and their level of interest in politics in general. We are aware that numbers of choices have been collected by the survey, however, we believe people weight more on their first choice when it comes to vote for a Party.</p>
